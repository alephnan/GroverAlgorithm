# Grover's Algorithm Implementation Design

## 1. Introduction

Brief overview of the project goals and the purpose of this design document.

## 2. Overall Circuit Design

High-level description of the Grover's algorithm circuit.
- Qubit initialization.
- Application of Hadamard gates.
- Iterative application of Oracle and Diffuser.
- Measurement.

## 3. Oracle Component Design

Detailed design of the Oracle function (`src/oracle.py`).
- How the target state(s) will be marked (e.g., phase flip).
- Specific Qiskit gates used.
- Parameterization (e.g., based on the target state).

## 4. Diffuser Component Design

Detailed design of the Diffuser (Amplitude Amplification) operator (`src/diffuser.py`).
- Mathematical description (inversion about the mean).
- Implementation using Hadamard, Pauli-X, and controlled-Z gates.
- Circuit diagram/description.

## 5. Circuit Composition and Workflow

How the Oracle and Diffuser are combined in `src/grover_circuit.py`.
- Flowchart or diagram showing the iterative process.
- Calculation of the optimal number of iterations.
- Integration with Qiskit's `QuantumCircuit`.

## 6. Performance Benchmarks

Target metrics for performance evaluation.
- Gate count.
- Circuit depth.
- Execution time (simulation and potentially hardware).
- Success probability.
